    "description": "Nehemiah Engineering Orbital Science is a collection of orbital science experiments aimed at prolonged station keeping. It consists of three distinct sets of experiments:\n* Kemini Research Program (KRP) - early-game experiments run from within a capsule based on real-life experiments run during the Gemini program.\n* Kerbal Environmental Effects Study (KEES) - mid-game experiments for attaching to the outside of a small station based on real-life material exposure experiments run on the MIR station.\n* Orbital Station Science (OSS) - Kerbal Life Science (KLS) and Orbital Material Science (OMS) - late-game large-scale station experiments based on real-life ISS experiments. These require modular station construction and maintenance.\n\nAll of the experiments are designed to be run in the background while the player performs other missions.",
