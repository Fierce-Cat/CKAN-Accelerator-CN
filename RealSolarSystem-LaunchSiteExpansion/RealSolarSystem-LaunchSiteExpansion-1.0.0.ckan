    "abstract": "RSSLSE is an addon to RSS & KSCSwitcher that adds just over 200 more launch sites to Earth. All are fictional, all are interesting in their own right. The ones close to the Poles are a bit glitchy; but I kept them anyway for your entertainment. Enjoy!! Drag the RSSLSE folder into GameData to install. Requires RSS & KSCSwitcher",
