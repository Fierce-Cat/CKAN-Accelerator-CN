    "description": "Inspired by the NASA mission LADEE. The objective of LADEE was to investigate the mysteries of the lunar atmosphere and the question of levitated lunar dust. It carried a scientific instrument called the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX). This instrument was an impact ionization dust detector. In this way it was possible to measure the density of dust particles.",
